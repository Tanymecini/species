## Dig deeper
Please contact us if you need extended access to the data underlying here. The TaxonWorks interfaces used to curate these data include wide range of additional filtering, reporting, and curatorial functionality. With a little training from us we'd be happy to provide you access to this additional functionality. Over time we expect this site to gradually mirror that extended functionality.

## Contact

## Taxonomic Data
 All data behind this site served as JSON through calls to a [TaxonWorks API](https://api.taxonworks.org). You can follow along by using the Console of your browser to explore the Network tab. Most specimen records and images are hosted on the [ecdysis](https://ecdysis.org) Symbiota portal, where the ASU Collections are actively digitized. Additional records originate from scientific literature or were accessed through [GBIF](https://gbif.org).

## Technical
Want to create your own site? This website is built completely on open-source software. There is a [site template](https://github.com/SpeciesFileGroup/<something>) with more information. Data are curated in a [TaxonWorks](https://taxonworks.org) project then shared via a [TaxonWorks API](https://api.taxonworks.org). Come [chat](https://gitter.im/SpeciesFileGroup/taxonworks) with the TaxonWorks community at any time.
